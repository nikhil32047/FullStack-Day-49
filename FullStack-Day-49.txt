Day 49:
==========

a) Using try and except Block
===================================
The try–except block is used to catch and handle runtime exceptions so the program does not crash.
Code that may cause an error is placed inside try, and error-handling code inside except.

Syntax:

try:
    risky_code
except ExceptionType:
    handling_code


Example:
try:
    x = int("abc")
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid conversion")

Key Points:
Prevents abnormal termination
Handles specific exceptions
Improves program reliability


b) Default except Block
===============================
A default except block catches all types of exceptions when the exception type is not specified.

Example:
try:
    a = 10 / 0
except:
    print("Some error occurred")

Key Points:
Handles unknown exceptions
Should be used carefully
Best placed after specific except blocks.
